#lables on your objects are called variables
#these are object references

print("Hello Jacob")
#unlike c# you don't have to name your variables string, double, decimal, int it does that automatically like var, so you have to be careful

first_name = "Ada"
print(first_name)
#to seperate points you can use a comma
print("these are", "joined")
#string interpolation
print("Hello", first_name)

#if we were to change first_name = 11 it would change it from ada to 11 without having to specify the int.
